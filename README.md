# Furniture Style Classifier
Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

I found an interesting book in a booksale in London which is a pictorial guide from the 1990s teaching people how to identify furniture styles. The book is meant as a concise resource for curators, furniture collectors, and connoisseurs, as well as students of history and decorative arts. The book also provides  My idea and fascniation is that if a person can read a book and learn to identify furniture styles, can an AI do it as well? 

## Background

The project is meant to provide a trained eye for furniture collectors, so it can predict what will be the best  How common or frequent is this problem? I love browsing design and furniture shops, and an AI like that could be a cool tool to have! Why is this topic important or interesting?

This is how you make a list, if you need one:
* Learn how to translate a visual guide into a textual reference for a computer program (probably a database?)
* The book has images with portions of furniture objects tagged and named, so they become clearly identifiable to the viewer. How can a set of images and related textual data/ labels be associated in a digital format, without too much manual processing? Maybe some kind of an image-OCR solution could help? Or another mini AI that can read a scan of a page, and make sense of it?   
* 


## How is it used?

The idea will be to be able to send a picture to the application, and the AI application should provide you the nearest match to the provided furniture image, and tell you why it showed you what it showed you. It should be able to label the various elements of an image based on the directions provided in the book as well! 

In the future, the AI should able to read descriptive page scans about furniture classification and typology building and learn from it:

## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
