## Story

I was wandering around in the streets of London, and stumbled across a book outside a bookshop in a sale. It was a pictorial guide from the 1990s teaching people how to identify furniture styles. The book is meant as a concise resource for curators, furniture collectors, and connoisseurs, as well as students of history and decorative arts. The book provide one page descriptions and images for 36 styles ranging from 1600s to 1900s. Almost instantly, I was fascinated by the idea that if a person can be trained to read a book and learn to identify furniture styles, can an AI do it as well?

## Motivation

The project is meant to provide a trained eye for furniture collectors, so it can predict what will be the best/ nearest possible visual style for the furniture.

This is how you make a list, if you need one:
* Learn how to translate a visual guide into a textual reference for a computer program (probably a database?)
* The book has images with portions of furniture objects tagged and named, so they become clearly identifiable to the viewer. How can a set of images and related textual data/ labels be associated in a digital format, without too much manual processing? Maybe some kind of an image-OCR solution could help? Or another mini AI that can read a scan of a page, and make sense of it?   
* 


## How is it used?

The idea will be to be able to send a picture to the application, and the AI application should provide you the nearest match to the provided furniture image, and tell you why it showed you what it showed you. It should be able to label the various elements of an image based on learning typical visual features of a furniture style from an era. 

In the future, the AI should able to read descriptive page scans about furniture classification and typology building and learn from it:

## Data sources and AI methods
The Idea is to be able to scavenge the internet for opensource, freely available image datasets to train an AI Model.
I found a few datasources online:
If you need to use links, here's an example:

## Challenges

Limitations: What does your project _not_ solve?
Ethical Considerations: Ethically any images which are still in copyright should be utilized only after procuring permissions/  a solution like this?

## What next?

Can this project grow and become something even more? 
I love browsing design and furniture shops, and an AI like that could be a cool tool to have on a mobile phone. Ideally a mobile phone app!

What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would I need to move on?
I would need to learn how to classify images using a **CNN**. I have learned that these are the kind of neural networks which can be trained to classify images.
